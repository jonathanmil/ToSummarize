In this class to summarize I learned about the importance of programmers and how the future of jobs as we know it must include technology and such needs to include programming</p><br>

In this website I will be going over all of the things that i have learned throughout my entire web design course. I will be discussing both semesters and all of the experiences that I had enoucntered throughout this course aswell in this website for the websdesign course.
<br><br>
Personally The reason that I had chosen to take this course was because I believed in technology and learning how to use it. I have previously taken web design courses and I have enjoyed it. This class would allow me to also build my own website which is something I have been meaning to do with my business ideas. I believe this class was an overall succesful exploration course and I HIGHLY reccomend everyone to take this course to experience it for themselves
