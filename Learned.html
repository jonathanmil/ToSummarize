<br><br>
<p>
During this class I learned so many things from learning the basics of html to css to also now being able to create my very own website completely from scratchw hich is what I previously thought was impossible for me to do. This class has truly opened my eyes to learned more about programming and now I am very informed and happy to understand code. I now want to learn about technology more that I previously wanted to and that is a good think for me to believe in. I also think that I learned the necessary material to research things on my own. I needed to learn a programming language completely from scratch and I ended up doing this all from the teacher and using technology that I was give. This class was very succesful and I would higly reccomend for other people to also take this class. It was great and I learn so much in technology that is related to building a website from scratch.<br><br>
